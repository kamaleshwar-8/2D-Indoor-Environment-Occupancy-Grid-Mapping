# 2D Indoor Environment Occupancy Grid Mapping

## Overview
This MATLAB script creates and visualizes a simple 2D occupancy grid map of an indoor environment, including walls, a door, and furniture.

## Features
- Binary occupancy grid representation
- Wall and door modeling
- Furniture (table) representation
- Grayscale visualization

## Map Components
- 10x10 grid size
- Binary occupancy (0 = free, 1 = occupied)
- Perimeter walls
- Single door on bottom wall
- 2x2 table obstacle

## Visualization
- Grayscale colormap
- Equal axis scaling
- Grid overlay
- Colorbar for reference
- Labeled axes

## Usage
1. Adjust grid size if needed
2. Modify obstacle positions as required
3. Run script to generate visualization
4. Use colorbar to interpret occupancy values

## Output
- Visual representation of the indoor environment
- Clear distinction between free and occupied spaces![2d env](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40007c99-545c-48b0-9b6a-6e28f88e92e4)
